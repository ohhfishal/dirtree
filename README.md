# dirtree

Batteries included alternative to `tree`. Uses `git` to only show included files.

## What I want
- Depth with `...` to denote files are omitted
- Git integration to guess on which files are relavent.


## Future Ideas
- More options (Hide dotfiles, full path)
- File/Directory metadata
- NerdFont Icons
- Tree sitter (Refresh periodically)
